        <p>Whether you‚Äôre interested in becoming a professional web developer or you simply want to learn more about how websites work, the first thing you need to study is HTML.</p>

        <p>HTML is the standard language that is used for creating webpages and web applications. Every time you access a website, a server sends an HTML file to your computer and your browser interprets and displays the information included in that file. In fact, all the information you are reading now is simply data that has been stored in an HTML file and sent to your browser.</p>
        
        <p>Here‚Äôs the best thing about HTML <br><strong>‚Äì it‚Äôs a simple language to learn.</strong></p>
        
        <p>Most people can learn the basics of HTML in just a few hours, and with a solid HTML foundation, you can progress to more complex languages such as CSS and JavaScript.</p>
        <br>

        <h2>What is HTML</h2>
        <p>HTML stands for <mark>HyperText Markup Language</mark>, which can be a confusing term for many beginners. The best way to explain HTML is to examine the meaning of each word.</p>

        <p><b>HyperText</b> refers to text that contains links to other texts. Every time you click on a highlighted or underlined link that takes to another page, you are using hypertext. As more and more pages use hypertext to link to each other, a ‚Äúweb‚Äù of pages starts to form. This is where we get the term Wide Web.</p>

        <p><b>Markup</b> refers to the special symbols or codes that are inserted into the document to tell the web browser how to display the document data. For example, markup code may tell the browser to display the phrase in bold or italic text, or may tell the browser which parts of the document are headings and which are paragraphs. HTML is just one of a number of languages that uses markup code.</p>

        <p><b>Language</b> refers to the idea that the code is standardized. Just like regular spoken languages, there are certain rules that everyone must follow when writing HTML. This is so that all browsers can understand and interpret the code. There are many different programming languages, and you may have heard of some of the popular ones such as Java, Python, and Ruby. Each language has its own unique set of rules, and many languages can be used in combination with HTML to create amazing webpages and applications.</p>

        <p>If we put these three definitions together, we could say that <mark>HTML is ‚Äúa programming language that uses unique code which allows you to display linked documents in a browser‚Äù.</mark></p>

        <h2>Why Should You Learn HTML?</h2>
        <p>These days, website builders such as Wix and SiteBuilder have made building websites easy. With a simple drag and drop interface and a variety of templates, anyone can build a website that is both functional and stylish.</p>

        <p>But what if you‚Äôre not interested in having a website that looks just like everyone else‚Äôs? What happens when you want to make changes to your site that go beyond what‚Äôs available using the drag and drop builder?</p>
        
        <p>With a basic knowledge of HTML (as well as a little CSS), you can build a truly unique website that you can edit and update yourself, and you won‚Äôt have to pay expensive monthly service fees.</p>

        <p>Learning HTML is also considered the first step for progressing into more complex and in-demand programming languages. Fancy earning a six-figure salary as a web developer for a Silicon Valley startup? Or maybe you‚Äôve got plans to develop the next Facebook or Twitter? If you‚Äôre interested in learning how to do any web-related programming, HTML is the place to start.</p>
